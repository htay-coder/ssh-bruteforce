# SSH Bruteforcer

An SSH brute-forcing tool that uses a wordlist is a security tool designed to test the strength of SSH login credentials. It works by systematically trying out different username and password combinations from a provided list to see if it can gain access to an SSH server.
Key Features:

- Wordlist: The tool uses a list of possible usernames and passwords trying each combination to find the correct credentials.

- Targeting: You can specify the target SSH server by entering its IP address or hostname via the script.

- Logging: It keeps track of successful login attempts and any relevant details by providing a summary report at the end of its run.

## Use Cases:

- Security Testing: Ethical hackers use this tool to check how vulnerable an SSH server is to brute-force attacks as part of a security assessment.
  
- Learning: Itâ€™s also used in cybersecurity training to show the importance of strong, unique passwords and secure SSH setups.
  
- System Auditing: IT administrators might use it to scan their own networks for weak or default credentials that need to be changed.

Important: While these tools are valuable for security testing, they can also be misused. Always ensure you have permission before running such tests on any system.
